This directory contains two files 2_spin.ipynb and 3_spin.ipynb depecting the time-evolution of the two-spin and three-spin Heisenberg model respectively 
In 2 spin model our hameltonian is simple as it contains only the interactions between two particles (along X, Y , Z axis) the quantum states at any time will be superposition of |00> , |01> , |10>, |11>
The 3 spin model is not so simple but to simplify the model we only considered the interactions between nearest particles that is between 1,2 and between 2,3 over here,the state at general time will be superposition of 8 different quantum states instead of 4.
