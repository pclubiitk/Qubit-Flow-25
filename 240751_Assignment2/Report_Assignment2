## Differences Between 2-Spin and 3-Spin Heisenberg Models\
In the two-spin Heisenberg model, we’re basically dealing with just two interacting qubits. This makes the system pretty simple, with only four possible states (00, 01, 10, 11), and the interactions happen directly between these two spins. The quantum circuit applies gates that represent their interactions, and the two qubits can become entangled straightforwardly. When we move to the three-spin model, things get more interesting and complex. Now there are three qubits, and interactions happen not just directly but also indirectly—for example, one qubit can influence another through the middle qubit. This leads to more possible states (eight in total: 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111) and richer patterns of entanglement and correlation. As a result, the quantum circuit becomes more involved, reflecting the greater complexity and richness of the system’s behavior.
